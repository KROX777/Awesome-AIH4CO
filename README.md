## AI-in-Heuristics
### Algorithm Selection & Generation
- AI helps select or generate heuristics.

### Algorithm Scheduling
- AI helps to decide which heuristics to run and/or for how long.

### Initialization
- AI helps heuristics by providing initial solution, pruning search space or setting initial parameters.

### In process
- AI helps heuristics in process by selecting operators, generating neighbors or setting online parameters.
